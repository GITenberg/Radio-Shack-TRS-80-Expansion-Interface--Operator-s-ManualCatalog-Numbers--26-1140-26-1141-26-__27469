<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The TRS-80 Expansion Interface (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) consists of the Case, a DC Power Supply, a Ribbon Cable, a Cassette
Recorder Jumper Cable and an additional Cassette Recorder Cable for Cassette Recorder number 2. Notice that the DC
Power Supply is not installed in the Case upon receipt. It must be installed using the procedures under the heading
"SETTING UP" and as illustrated in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<p>The Case houses the Expansion Interface Printed Circuit Board (PCB), two DC Power Supplies and provides a housing
area for an additional expansion PCB. The Expansion Interface utilizes a real-time clock and contains sockets for the
addition of up to 32K of RAM in 16K increments.</p>

<p>One DC Power Supply provides power to the PCB. The other one supplies power to the TRS-80. The Power Supplies
are interchangeable.</p>

<p>The ribbon cable has 40-pin connectors on both ends and is used to connect the Expansion Interface to the TRS-80.
You received hoods for these connectors which are covered later in this manual.</p>

<p>The Cassette Recorder Jumper Cable has 5-pin audio DIN connectors on both ends. It connects between the Expansion
Interface Tape input/output (I/O) and the TAPE connector on the right rear of the TRS-80 Microcomputer.</p>

<p>The Cassette Recorder Cable is provided to connect the Expansion Interface to Cassette Recorder number 2.</p>


<h3>CAPABILITIES AND ADVANTAGES</h3>

<p>The Interface allows you to add the following Radio Shack modules to your system:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1. Screen Printer (26-1151)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2. Line Printer (26-1150)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">3. Mini-Disk System (26-1160/26-1161)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4. Cassette Recorder number 2 (14-841)</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Screen Printer and Line Printer allow you to obtain hard copy (printed) information generated by your TRS-80.</p>

<p>The TRS-80 Mini-Disk System is a small version of the floppy disk. It provides vast storage space and much quicker
access time than tape. The number 1 disk contains about 80,000 bytes of free space for files. Each additional disk has
89,600 bytes of file space. The Disk System has its own set of commands that allow manipulation of files and expanded
abilities in file use. The TRS-80 Mini-Disk System uses sequential or random access. The disks will allow use of
several additional LEVEL II commands.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><b><big>IMPORTANT NOTE</big></b></p>

<p>Because of the presence of a Disk Controller in the Expansion
Interface, the computer will try to input the additional
commands.</p>

<p>When the Expansion Interface is connected to the computer,
it assumes that a Mini-Disk is connected. To use the
Expansion Interface without a Mini-Disk, press the BREAK
key on the TRS-80 keyboard. This will override the Mini-Disk
mode and allow normal LEVEL II operation.</p></div>

<p>The use of two cassettes allows a much more efficient and convenient manner of updating data stored on tape. For example,
if you have payroll data stored on tape, the information can be read, one item at a time, from Cassette Recorder
number 1, then changed or added to and written out on Cassette Recorder number 2. The example cited is a very simple
application; however, very powerful routines can be constructed to allow input and output of data using two tapes
simultaneously.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><b><big>CAUTION</big></b></p>

<p>This unit is designed to be used with Level II only. <b>Do not
use with level I.</b></p></div>

<h2>SETTING UP</h2>


<p><b><big>Power Supplies and PCB Housing</big></b> (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>)</p>

<p>Remove the Power Supply Door (top right side). First connect one DC power cord (DIN connector) to the Power connector
on the PCB. Now install the two DC Power Supplies as illustrated. Route the remaining cords out the rear of
the case. Be sure the power cords are seated in the door cutouts before replacing the Door.</p>

<p>To gain access to the future expansion PCB Housing, remove the Expansion Door from the top left side of the module.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 490px;">
<a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><img src="images/image002.png" width="490" height="349" alt="FIGURE 2. Power Supplies and Future

</p>
<p class="center">NOTE: INSTALL EXPANSION INTERFACE DC POWER SUPPLY <b>FIRST</b>.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><b><big>NOTE</big></b></p>

<p>The term "port" as used in this manual refers to the openings
into which the Cable connectors are inserted to provide
an interconnection between the TRS-80 and the Expansion
Interface modules.</p></div>

<p>The ports, with the exception of the Expansion Interface port, are also covered by removable Doors. To remove these
Doors, press on the right side of the Door and it will pivot slightly. Grasp the left side of the Door and pull out (see <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>
for locations).</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">

<span class="caption">FIGURE 3. Expansion Interface,
Front View&mdash;Doors Removed.</span>
</p>


<p><b><big>Electrical Connections</big></b> (see <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>)</p>

<p>Turn the TRS-80 so that it faces away from you. Locate the port Door (1400083); it's at the right end of the rear panel.
To remove the Door, raise it up and slide it to the right&mdash;then lift it up and away from the TRS-80.</p>

<p>Place the TRS-80 and Expansion Interface Hoods (14000217 and 14000214) on the Ribbon Cable Connectors as shown
in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>. The Hoods replace the Door on the TRS-80 and fill the opening on the Expansion Interface. These Hoods
are designed so that it is not possible to insert the connectors upside down. They function as keyways for the connectors.
Now connect the Ribbon Cable between the left front Expansion Interface port and the TRS-80 port.</p>

<p>Connect the DC Power Cord (DIN connector) to the POWER connector on the right rear of the TRS-80 and connect
both AC Power Cords to standard 120 VAC outlets.</p>

<p>The interconnect cable for an expansion module is provided with that unit. See <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> for Hood Assembly and Installation.</p>

<p>Connect the Cassette Recorder Cable (DIN plug on one end and three plugs on the other) to the Tape I/O connector
that is located on the rear of the Expansion Interface nearest the Power Cord exits. (Refer to <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).</p>

<p>Of the three plugs on the other end of the Cable:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">1. Connect the black plug to the EAR jack on the side of the Cassette Recorder.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">2. Connect the larger gray plug to the AUX jack.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">3. Connect the smaller gray plug to the REM jack.</span></p>


<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><b><big>NOTE</big></b></p>

<p>A Dummy Plug is provided with your Cassette Recorder.
Plug it in to the MIC jack. This Plug disconnects the built-in
microphone so it won't pick up sounds while you are
loading tapes.</p></div>

</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Connect the Cassette Recorder Jumper Cable to the center DIN connector on the rear of the Expansion Interface. Connect
the other end to the TAPE connector on the right rear of the TRS-80.</p>

<p>Connect the Video Cable from the Video Display to the VIDEO connector on the right rear of the TRS-80.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><b><big>NOTE</big></b></p>

<p>Your Cassette Recorders may be powered by batteries or
from a 120 VAC source. Thus, AC power cords are optional.</p></div>

<p>The TRS-80 Expansion Interface has been designed to support the Video Display module. Set the feet of the Video
Display in the recesses in the Power Supply and PCB Housing Doors. (Refer to <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>).</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>OPERATION</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><b><big>NOTE</big></b></p>

<p>The Power switch is recessed into the front of the Expansion
Interface to prevent accidental loss of power. Activate
the switch with the eraser-end of a pencil or small tool of
similar size.</p></div>

<p>Apply power to the Expansion Interface. Notice that when power is off, the end surface of the switch is white and
when power is on, it changes to orange.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>


<p>Possibly, you will not need all of the expansion modules that are available but, we have supplied you with Hoods for
cable connectors for a complete expansion system. Use the Hoods as illustrated to prevent accidental mismatch between
the edge connectors on the PCB and the cable connectors.</p>

<p>In the event that you lose a Door or Hood and want to replace it, we have given you a Parts List. You may refer to the
Parts List and exploded diagrams to determine its Part Number. You can order replacement parts through your local
Radio Shack store.</p>

<p>You must have a LEVEL II BASIC TRS-80 Microcomputer to utilize the TRS-80 Expansion Interface, the Line Printer
and the Mini-Disk modules. If you have a LEVEL I BASIC machine, it must be modified to accept LEVEL II programs.
The Screen Printer is the only expansion module that may be connected directly to the TRS-80 Microcomputer and
that will operate with LEVEL I machines.</p>

<p>We are continually improving and updating our TRS-80 Microcomputer System. You will be kept informed through our
Newsletters (you are on the mailing list), addenda and revisions to the Manual.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
